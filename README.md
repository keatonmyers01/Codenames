4-6 players
Rules:
pick split into 2 teams with one guesser and one spy master
when the program starts only the spy masters can look at the screen
take a picture of the generated key, this will not be printed again and is needed
Starting with the blue team the spy master will say one word followed by a number
the team mate(s) will know there are currently that many words associated with that
word and can make that many guesses, or until they fail to choose one of thier agents.
If they use all of thier alloted guesses they may chose to make one more guess to get any
words they think may be thier color. There is a single black agent
if the guesser acidently picks the black agent it is an instant loss

Note:
Blue team always goes first
Blue has 8 cards to reveal Red has 7
You may not say any of the actual words on the board
